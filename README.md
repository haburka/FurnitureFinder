# FurnitureFinder

Hey tiff and xinhai!
Please download google play services from the standalone SDK manager, under extras to use this app. 

Sync gradle whenever you update this project. If that doesn't work, try importing the project??? 

IF you run into issues, please document them by telling me what you did using issues here:
https://github.com/haburka/FurnitureFinder/issues/new

Make your issues detailed(What did you do? What did you try?) and post error messages. That way I can figure out how I fucked up!




To contribute just do this:

git pull origin master
git add . -A
gitk (Look at your commit. Does it have everything you want in it? Is there anything extra that you don't want in? If so, fix it and run another git add . -A)
git commit -a -m "MESSAGE"
git push origin master

That should be all you need to know right now. Direct any questions towards me.
